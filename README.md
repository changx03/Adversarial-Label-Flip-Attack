# Adversarial-Label-Flip-Attack
  
 Implementation of the research paper Xiao, Han, Huang Xiao, and Claudia Eckert. **"Adversarial Label Flips Attack on Support Vector Machines."** ECAI. 2012.
 
 - Addresses the problem of label flips attack where an adversary contaminates the training set through flipping labels
 - Formulates an optimization framework
for finding the label flips that maximize the classification error in Support Vector Machine
